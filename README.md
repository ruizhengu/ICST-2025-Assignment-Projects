### APR Tool Selection

We perform the APR tool selection process based on the existing APR tools from [program-repair.org](https://program-repair.org/tools.html).

1. applicable for Java program repair
2. publicly available
3. not aimed at repairing *only* specific types of faults, e.g., concurrency
4. unrestricted repair scopes/operators (e.g., not limited to only repairing conditional statements)
5. not built exclusively for existing benchmarks (e.g., Defects4J)
6. use a redundancy-based approach, (i.e., able to use existing code as repair ingredients)
7. executable without compilation errors (or errors solvable with reasonable efforts)
